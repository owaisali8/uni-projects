# University Projects
This repository contains legacy projects I worked on during my undergraduate studies

- <u>**[Hotel Reservation System](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/Hotel%20Reservation%20System%20on%20Java-Swing%20GUI-OOP/Project)**</u>: OOP Project made in Java Swing GUI library using Netbeans. Allows clients and admins to manage bookings.
- <u>**[Java Text Editor](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/Java_Text_Editor)**</u>: A simple Text editor made with Swing GUI on Netbeans. It implements basic features in order to signify the importance of Data Structures. 
- <u>**[Research on Cryptography](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/LA_Project_Cryptography)**</u>:  Implementation of cryptographic techniques in Python to show importance of Linear Algebra.
- <u>**[Numerical Computing Methods](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/NA_Assignments)**</u>: Programming of interpolation of polynomials and root-finding problems in Python.
- <u>**[Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/Genetic_Algorithm)**</u>: Program in python to solve the 8 Queens Problem using a genetic algorithm
- <u>**[Hypothetical Architecture](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/CAAL_Hypothetical_Architecture)**</u>:  MARIE architecture in its simplest form made in Logisim.
- <u>**[Pyaint](https://github.com/owaisali8/Pyaint)**</u>:  An open source paint program using Python and Pygame
- <u>**[16-bit Architecture on Java](https://github.com/owaisali8/Java-OS-Project)**</u>: Virtual Environment build on Java for our OS course
- <u>**[Linear Regression in CUDA C](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mywu_UfS5kMrKkzrr8l3B3cMOcJaX38V?usp=sharing)**</u>:  Supervised machine learning algorithm in CUDA C for PDC course.
- <u>**[K-Means Clustering in CUDA Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JuKu3uRkS42RkKiiz0apNKJMINCEErLm?usp=sharing)**</u>:  Unsupervised machine learning algorithm in CUDA Python using Numba for PDC course. Main takeaway was to built an algorithm for GPU which finds K-Means faster with same accuracy.
- <u>**[Kaam Daam: Web-Dev](https://github.com/owaisali8/web-dev-project)**</u>: Fullstack Application that connects service providers with customers in need. Tech Stack: React, Flutter, Node, Postgre and Express.js
- <u>**[SupaPay: App-Dev](https://github.com/owaisali8/Supapay-Fintech-App)**</u>: An application built on Flutter and Firebase that provides basic financial services, such as mobile banking and customer support.
- <u>**[Food Recognition using CNNs and Fine-tuned MobileNetv2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i3FsuBXj6Ckb468AcViPmH7uIua2eZ2U?usp=sharing)**</u>: Develop and deploy deep learning models for accurately identifying and classifying various food items from images. The project utilizes popular deep learning architectures, including MobileNetV2, a custom CNN built from scratch, and VGG16. It identifies the image then fetches its calorie count. Project utilizes the Food-101 dataset, a comprehensive collection of images featuring 101 distinct food categories.
- <u>**[Analysis of Motor Vehicle Collisions in NYC with GeoLocation | Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYzQxOWExMDYtYjYzOC00NzVhLThkOWYtZWY5YmUyODVmMjQ0IiwidCI6ImZlZTNiOTE2LTAxYzEtNDk4Ny1hNjQ2LWUxOTM0MzJiOWVhYSIsImMiOjl9&pageName=ReportSection)**</u>: Project contains a dashboard which shows NYC Vehicle collisions after performing [EDA and MVA](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UrNvkzSdwMKSztF8V8QkNzdZvUXKOdum). Dashboard shows insights of where, when and how accidents are occurring. To find insights and conclude why are they occurring. Data time-frame is from 2017-2023.
- <u>**[HCI | Revamped SadaPay UI & UX](https://www.figma.com/file/5tQMVekk2VGvR8JKfsArC3/HCI-Phase-2?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=oi9LPUwCt94lZj6q-1)**</u>: 
The SadaPay app enhancement project represents a comprehensive effort to improve user experience and accessibility for a diverse user base. In the design phase, running prototypes were developed based on insights gathered from field studies, user interviews, and evaluations of existing interfaces. The redesign focused on addressing issues identified in the first phase, incorporating novel ideas to enhance visual aesthetics, usability, and inclusivity. The evaluation phase employed various Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) methods, including comparative analysis with other fintech apps, surveys, and user feedback, guiding an iterative design process. Notable features such as Quick Request, Feature Request, Feedback, Accessibility options, OTP Status, Facial Recognition, and Transaction Status were added to enhance efficiency, security, and transparency. The redesigned home screen and customizable options contribute to a positive user experience. Overall, the project showcases a commitment to inclusivity, accessibility, and user satisfaction, ensuring the SadaPay app meets the diverse needs of its users.
