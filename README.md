# University Projects
This repository contains legacy projects I worked on during my undergraduate studies

- <u>**[Hotel Reservation System](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/Hotel%20Reservation%20System%20on%20Java-Swing%20GUI-OOP/Project)**</u>: OOP Project made in Java Swing GUI library using Netbeans. Allows clients and admins to manage bookings.
- <u>**[Java Text Editor](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/Java_Text_Editor)**</u>: A simple Text editor made with Swing GUI on Netbeans. It implements basic features in order to signify the importance of Data Structures. 
- <u>**[Research on Cryptography](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/LA_Project_Cryptography)**</u>:  Implementation of cryptographic techniques in Python to show importance of Linear Algebra.
- <u>**[Numerical Computing Methods](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/NA_Assignments)**</u>: Programming of interpolation of polynomials and root-finding problems in Python.
- <u>**[Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/Genetic_Algorithm)**</u>: Program in python to solve the 8 Queens Problem using a genetic algorithm
- <u>**[Hypothetical Architecture](https://github.com/owaisali8/uni-projects/tree/main/CAAL_Hypothetical_Architecture)**</u>:  MARIE architecture in its simplest form made in Logisim.
- <u>**[Pyaint](https://github.com/owaisali8/Pyaint)**</u>:  An open source paint program using Python and Pygame
- <u>**[16-bit Architecture on Java](https://github.com/owaisali8/Java-OS-Project)**</u>: Virtual Environment build on Java for our OS course
- <u>**[Linear Regression in CUDA C](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mywu_UfS5kMrKkzrr8l3B3cMOcJaX38V?usp=sharing)**</u>:  Supervised machine learning algorithm in CUDA C for PDC course.
- <u>**[K-Means Clustering in CUDA Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JuKu3uRkS42RkKiiz0apNKJMINCEErLm?usp=sharing)**</u>:  Unsupervised machine learning algorithm in CUDA Python using Numba for PDC course. Main takeaway was to built an algorithm for GPU which finds K-Means faster with same accuracy.
- <u>**[Kaam Daam: Web-Dev](https://github.com/owaisali8/web-dev-project)**</u>: Fullstack Application that connects service providers with customers in need. Tech Stack: React, Flutter, Node, Postgre and Express.js
- <u>**[SupaPay: App-Dev](https://github.com/owaisali8/Supapay-Fintech-App)**</u>: An application built on Flutter and Firebase that provides basic financial services, such as mobile banking and customer support.
