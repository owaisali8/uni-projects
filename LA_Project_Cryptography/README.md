# Linear Algebra Project on Cryptography

This Jupyter notebook contains few methods on cryptographic techniques along with code to show how it is working. Numpy is a library for Python which allows support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Numpy arrays are used here in the process of encryption and decryption.
