# Numerical Analysis Assignments 

This repository contains code for different methods mentioned in numerical computing. Interpolation of polynomials and root-finding problems are covered here including:
- Bisection Method
- Fixed Point Method
- Newton Method
- Lagrange Polynomial 
- Cubic Spline 
- Divided Difference 

Python is used here along with popular libraries including: Matplotlib, Scipy, Sympi, Numpy and tabulate. Filing was a requirement that is why you will find txt files alongside code which contains data on examples which have been run on that code.
